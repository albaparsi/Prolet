The purpose of this program is to calculate the (working-age) per-capita GDP and display it in dollars and cents. 
In order to do that we need to calculate the epoch, the number of quarters between year zero and the user's chosen date, 
and the number of quarters between the 1st quarter 1977 and the date for which the user wants to calculate the expected (working-age) per-capita GDP.
After the calculation we use the given functions to calculate GDP and turn that into a properly formatted output.
The program prompts the user for two inputs (year and quarter). 
It gathers the inputs and does the appropriate calculation and at the end displays the proper output.
